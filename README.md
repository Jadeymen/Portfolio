## 👩‍💼 About me
I'm a BSc Geophysics graduate from Imperial College London with a strong analytical foundation and a keen interest in using data to explore real-world problems. My background spans geophysical investigation, project coordination, and data-driven research, and I’ve recently expanded my expertise through formal training in data analytics and cloud fundamentals.

I enjoy working with data to generate insights, create impactful visualisations, and support informed decision-making. My work is driven by curiosity, clarity, and a commitment to continuous learning.

## 📊 Portfolio projects

### 🐍 Python

#####  [1. Australia's Energy Transition & Emissions Pathway (1990-2023)](Python)

Examines Australia's emissions, energy mix, and economic growth to assess progress towards the 2050 Net Zero target. Integrates national datasets, policy timelines, and statistical forecasting to identify where emissions reductions align or diverge from climate commitments, providing actionable insights for sustainability and energy-market analysis.

_Tools: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn_
